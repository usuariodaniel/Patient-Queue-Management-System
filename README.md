# How It Works

The provided JavaScript code is a simple queue management system for patients using a do...while loop and a switch statement. It allows users to add new patients to the queue, consult the next patient in the queue, and exit the system.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

1. The code starts by declaring an empty array queue and a variable option which will store the user's choice in the menu.

2. The do...while loop runs as long as the option is not equal to "3" (Exit). Inside the loop, the following steps are performed:

   - A string patients is initialized as an empty string. This string will store the list of patients in the queue.
   - A for loop is used to iterate over the queue array. For each patient, a string is appended to patients in the format "i+1ยบ - queue[i]\n", where i+1 is the patient's position in the queue and queue[i] is the patient's name.
   - The prompt function is used to display a dialog box with the list of patients and a menu for the user to choose an option. The user's choice is stored in the option variable.
   - A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on the user's choice

3. The do...while loop continues to run until the user chooses to exit (option "3"), at which point the option variable is set to "3" and the loop terminates
